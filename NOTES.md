# Pomodoro 1
âœ… 1 large outside-in test:
  WHEN Horizontal victory (top row) for Player X
  EXPECT output to be an array of printed moves

ðŸš§ should be split up into:
- Game files
âœ…  Board
  âœ…  board should render on creation
  âœ…  renderBoard function broken (causing infinite loop)
- Player

# Pomodoro 2
âœ…  Create Player files
ðŸš§ Delete old index file and test
- Player tests:
  - GIVEN a TicTacToe Player
    - WHEN the Player is initialised
      - THEN their pin is set
    - WHEN the Player takes a turn
      - THEN their pin is placed on the board

# Tech Debt
- worthless tests
- might be worth using classes
