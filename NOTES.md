# Pomodoro 1
âœ… 1 large outside-in test:
  WHEN Horizontal victory (top row) for Player X
  EXPECT output to be an array of printed moves

ðŸš§ should be split up into Board, Player and Game files
- board should render on creation
  - renderBoard function broken (causing infinite loop)


# Tech Debt
- worthless tests
