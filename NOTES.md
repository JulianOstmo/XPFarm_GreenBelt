# Pomodoro 1
âœ… 1 large outside-in test:
  WHEN Horizontal victory (top row) for Player X
  EXPECT output to be an array of printed moves

ðŸš§ should be split up into:
- Game files
âœ…  Board
  âœ…  board should render on creation
  âœ…  renderBoard function broken (causing infinite loop)
- Player


# Tech Debt
- worthless tests
- might be worth using classes
